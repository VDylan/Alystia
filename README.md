## About

Alystia is currently a simple bot with no options.

But in the future, we want this bot to be able to define a new role when a user joins a Discord server or says a welcome message on a specific channel.

Alystia was made with :

- NodeJS
- Discord.js
- A lot of Love

## Installation

**Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.**

In first, clone (or fork if you want to contrib) and initialize it with : `npm install`

When it's done, create a new file and name it `settings.js`

Then, put that in :

```js
"use strict";

module.exports = {
  TOKEN: "Your Token here",
  PREFIX: "The Prefix you want for the bot"
};
```

Finally, don't forget to replace `token` and `prefix` with your parameters.
